# Volunteer Hours Logger

## Project Overview
The Volunteer Hours Logger is a Python command-line application created for
CYBR-2101 Python Essentials (Service-Learning). It allows small organizations
to record volunteer hours using a structured interface and stores records
locally in a CSV file so that entries persist between runs.

## Skills Learned
This project reinforced Python fundamentals including input validation,
functions, file I/O, and program structure. I also practiced debugging,
documentation, and organizing a project for reuse.

## AI Concepts Connection
I used AI-assisted tools during development to help debug logic errors,
refactor code for readability, and improve documentation. This showed
how AI can augment learning and productivity while enforcing best
practices in coding.
